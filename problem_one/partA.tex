\subsection*{Problem 1 Part A Linear Program Formulation}
\begin{enumerate}[1.]
	\item Overall idea of problem
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Refrigerators moving from $n=4$ plants to $q=3$ warehouses to $m=7$ retailers.
		\item Not all plants deliver to all warehouses.
		\item Not all warehouses deliver to all retailers.
		\item Costs of shipping from plants to warehouses vary by pair.
		\item Costs of shipping from warehouses to retailers vary by pair.
		\item Each plant has a capacity in terms of number of refrigerators it can supply.
		\item Each retailer has a capacity in terms of number of refrigerators it demands.
	\end{itemize}
	\item What is the goal?  What are you trying to achieve?
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Determine optimal shipping routes ($n$ to $q$ and $q$ to $m$).
		\item Determine number of refrigerators moving along each route ($n$ to $q$ and $q$ to $m$).
		\item Satisfy the demand of the retailers.
		\item Minimize the cost.
	\end{itemize}
	\item Identify variables
	\begin{itemize}
		\item $cp_{ij}$ = cost of moving a refrigerator between plant i and warehouse j
		\begin{itemize}
			\item   ex. $cp_{32} = 8$ = cost of moving from plant 3 to warehouse 2
			\item   9 variables
		\end{itemize}
		\item $cw_{jk}$ = cost of moving a refrigerator between warehouse j and retailer k
		\begin{itemize}
  			\item  ex. $cp_{14} = 10$ = cost of moving from warehouse 1 to retailer 4
  			\item  12 variables
		\end{itemize}
		\item $s_i$ = capacity (supply) of each plant
		\begin{itemize}
 			\item   ex. $s_2 = 450$ = number of refrigerators that plant 2 can supply
			\item    4 variables
		\end{itemize}
		\item $d_k$ = capacity (demand) of each retailer
		\begin{itemize}
			\item    ex. $d_6 = 150$ = number of refrigerators that plant 6 demands
