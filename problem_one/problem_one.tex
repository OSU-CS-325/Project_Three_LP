\subsection*{Part A}
Determine the number of refrigerators to be shipped from plants to warehouses, and then warehouses to retailers to minimize the cost.

\begin{enumerate}[i.]
	\item Formulate the problem as a linear program with an objective function and all constraints.

	\item Determine the optimal solution for the linear program using any software you want. Include a copy of the code/file in the report.

	\item What are the optimal shipping routes and minimum cost?
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Part B}
Due to old infrastructure, Warehouse 2 is going to close, eliminating all of the associated routes. What is the optimal solution for this modified model? Is it feasible to ship all the refrigerators to either Warehouse 1 or 3 and then to the retailers without using Warehouse 2? Why or why not?

\subsection*{Part C}
Instead of closing Warehouse 2, management has decided to keep a portion of it open but limit shipments to 100 refrigerators per week. Is this feasible? If so, what is the optimal solution when Warehouse 2 is limited to 100 refrigerators?

\subsection*{Part D}
Formulate a generalized linear programming model for the transshipment problem. Give the objective function and constraints as mathematical formulas.
