1.  Overall idea of problem

Refrigerators moving from n=4 plants to q=3 warehouses to m=7 retailers.
Not all plants deliver to all warehouses.
Not all warehouses deliver to all retailers.
Costs of shipping from plants to warehouses vary by pair.
Costs of shipping from warehouses to retailers vary by pair.
Each plant has a capacity in terms of number of refrigerators it can supply.
Each retailer has a capacity in terms of number of refrigerators it demands.

2.  What is the goal?  What are you trying to achieve?

Determine optimal shipping routes (n->q and q->m).
Determine number of refrigerators moving along each route (n->q and q->m).
Satisfy the demand of the retailers.
Minimize the cost.

3.  Identify variables

cpij = cost of moving a refrigerator between plant i and warehouse j
  ex. cp32 = $8 = cost of moving from plant 3 to warehouse 2
cwjk = cost of moving a refrigerator between warehouse j and retailer k
  ex. cp14 = $10 = cost of moving from warehouse 1 to retailer 4
si = capacity (supply) of each plant
  ex. s2 = 450 = number of refrigerators that plant 2 can supply
dk = capacity (demand) of each retailer
  ex. d6 = 150 = number of refrigerators that plant 6 demands
npij = number of refrigerators shipped from plant i to warehouse j
nwjk = number of refrigerators shipped from warehouse j to retailer k

4.  Identify constraints

s1 <= 150
s2 <= 450
s3 <= 250
s4 <= 150
d1 >= 100
d2 >= 150
d3 >= 100
d4 >= 200
d5 >= 200
d6 >= 150
d7 >= 100
cp11 + cp21 + cp31        = cw11 + cw12 + cw13 + cw14
cp12 + cp22 + cp32 + cp42 =               cw23 + cw24 + cw25 + cw26
              cp33 + cp43 =                      cw34 + cw35 + cw36 + cw37
s1 = cp11 + cp12
s2 = cp21 + cp22
s3 = cp31 + cp32 + cp33
s4 =        cp42 + cp43
d1 = cw11
d2 = cw12
d3 = cw13 + cw23
d4 = cw14 + cw24 + cw34
d5 =        cw25 + cw35
d6 =        cw26 + cw36
d7 =                      cw37
np11 >= 0
np12 >= 0
np21 >= 0
np22 >= 0
np31 >= 0
np32 >= 0
np33 >= 0
np42 >= 0
np43 >= 0
nw11 >= 0
nw12 >= 0
nw13 >= 0
nw14 >= 0
nw23 >= 0
nw24 >= 0
nw25 >= 0
nw26 >= 0
nw34 >= 0
nw35 >= 0
nw36 >= 0
nw37 >= 0

5.  Identify inputs and outputs that you can control

npij
nwjk
cost

6.  Specify all quantities mathematically

Many have been defined above already.  A few more will be added here.

cost = [sum of (npij*cpij) for all routes between plants and warehouses]
     + [sum of (nwjk*cwjk) for all routes between warehoues and retailers]

cp11 = 10
cp12 = 15
cp21 = 11
cp22 = 8
cp31 = 13
cp32 = 8
cp33 = 9
cp42 = 14
cp43 = 8
cw11 = 5
cw12 = 6
cw13 = 7
cw14 = 10
cw23 = 12
cw24 = 8
cw25 = 10
cw26 = 14
cw34 = 14
cw35 = 12
cw36 = 12
cw37 = 6

7.  Check the model for completeness and correctness

All variables are positive.
