	\item What are the lengths of the shortest paths from vertex $a$ to all other vertices?
    An image of the graph is below:

    \includegraphics{../problem_three/problem3_digraph.png}

    The lengths of the shortest paths from a to the other vertices in the graph are listed below:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item a to b: 2
        \item a to c: 3
        \item a to d: 8
        \item a to e: 9
        \item a to f: 6
        \item a to g: 8
        \item a to h: 9
        \item a to i: 8
        \item a to j: 13
        \item a to k: 15
        \item a to l: 17
        \item a to m: 10
    \end{itemize}
	\item If a vertex $z$ is added to the graph for which there is no path from vertex $a$ to vertex $z$, what will be the result when you attempt to find the lengths of shortest paths as in part a).

Graphic with the new vertex z added:

The list will be the same except for the addition of the line 'a to z: Inf' which shows that you cannot access vertex z from a in the current graph because that is what was specified in the question.

	\item What are the lengths of the shortest paths from each vertex to vertex $m$? How can you solve this problem with just one linear program?

  \begin{itemize}
      \item a to m: 10
      \item b to m: 8
      \item c to m: 8
      \item d to m: 5
      \item e to m: 12
      \item f to m: 4
      \item g to m: 7
      \item h to m: 7
      \item i to m: 2
      \item j to m: 6
      \item k to m: 10
      \item l to m: 2
  \end{itemize}

	\item Suppose that all paths must pass through vertex $i$. How can you calculate the length of the shortest path from any vertex $x$ to vertex $y$ that pass through vertex $i$ (for all $x, y \in V$)? Calculate the lengths of these paths for the given graph. (Note: for some vertices $x$ and $y$, it may be impossible to pass through vertex $i$).
