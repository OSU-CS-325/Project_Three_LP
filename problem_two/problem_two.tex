\subsection*{Part A}
Determine the combination of ingredients that minimizes calories but meets all nutritional requirements.

\begin{enumerate}[i.]
	\item Formulate the problem as a linear program with an objective function and all constraints.

	\item Determine the optimal solution for the linear program using any software you want. Include a copy of the code/file in the report.

	\item What is the cost of the low calorie salad?
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Part B}
Veronica realizes that it is also important to minimize the cost associated with the new salad. Unfortunately some of the ingredients can be expensive. Determine the combination of ingredients that minimizes cost.

\begin{enumerate}[i.]
	\item Formulate the problem as a linear program with an objective function and all constraints.

	\item Determine the optimal solution for the linear program using any software you want. Include a copy of the code/file in the report.

	\item How many calories are in the low cost salad?
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Part C}
Compare the results from part A and B. Veronica’s goal is to create a Very Veggie Salad that is both low calorie and low cost. She would like to sell the salad for \$5.00 and still have a profit of at least \$3.00. However if she can advertise that the salad has under 250 calories then she may be able to sell more.

\begin{enumerate}[i.]
	\item Suggest some possible ways that she select a combination of ingredients that is “near optimal” for both objectives. This is a type of multi-objective optimization.

	\item What combination of ingredient would you suggest and what is the associated cost and calorie.

	\item Note: There is not one “right” answer. Discuss how you derived your solution.
\end{enumerate}
